# MY API

This example shows how to implement a **GraphQL server with TypeScript** with the following stack:

- [**Apollo Server**](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server): HTTP server for GraphQL APIs   
- [**GraphQL Nexus**](https://nexusjs.org/docs/): GraphQL schema definition and resolver implementation 
- [**Prisma Client**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client): Databases access (ORM)                  
- [**Prisma Migrate**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate): Database migrations               
- [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): Local, file-based SQL database

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and install dependencies

Download this example:

```
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=2 prisma-examples-latest/typescript/graphql
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd graphql
npm install
```

<details><summary><strong>Alternative:</strong> Clone the entire repo</summary>

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/typescript/graphql
npm install
```

</details>

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Now, seed the database with the sample data in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) by running the following command:

```
npx prisma db seed --preview-feature
```


### 3. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).


## Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./schema.graphql`](./schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.
